Binaries compiled with cross compiler mingw64 for Windows (64bit) & Gnu 7.4.0 for Linux.
- fixed infinite loop 99% when iso files are corrupted;
- added Performer tag to dsf files;
- multi-byte chars in filenames is supported for Windows when input files are iso (using wmain);
- better management in creating folders/files/tracks names (including albums with multiple discs);
- folders are created like this: Album name/(Disc no)/(Stereo or 5ch or 6ch). If configuration file sacd_extract.cfg exist in working folder of app(which can be shown with -v option) and has text lines: 'artist=1' (and/or 'performer=1') it adds artist at the name of folder and/or adds performer at the filename of tracks;
- changed priority in title/artist extracting metadata. Now disc_title/disc_artist came first instead of album_title/album_artist (useful in case of multiple discs of an album);
- added -w (--concurrent) for compatibility with SACDExtractGUI;
- added -o (--output-dir[=DIR] ) and -y (--output-dir-conc[=DIR]) options for setting explicit output folder (for compatibility with SACDExtractGUI);
- for DSF/DFF files, the pops/crackles noise is reduced by trimming frames at track boundaries;
- audio frames are trimmed out (based on timecode) at boundaries to reflect the correct playing time of tracks specified in Tracklist. This is done for DSF/DFF files (no for DFF-EM);
- eliminates crashes when disk for output is full;
- corrected behavior in case of discs with only one multi-channel area (with no stereo area);
- added total play time for each area when printing disc info;
- now it strips out ending slash or backslash, if exists, at --output-dir or --output-dir-conc to be compatible with BatchEncoder;
- added xml metadata file export option (is activated when Cue sheet is checked). Libray libxml2 is used;
- added more integrity checks of the audio frames; 
- fixed 2 BUGS which can make pops/crackles noises at the end of DSF/DFF tracks;
- added -z (--dsf-nopad) option, (now is fully compatible with SACDExtractGUI);
- added 'audio_frame_trimming=1' option in sacd_extract.cfg (see above 'audio frames are trimmed out....').
