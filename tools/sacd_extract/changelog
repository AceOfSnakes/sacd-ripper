version 0.3.9.3 prelease

Binaries compiled with mingw32 for Windows (64bit) & Gnu 7.4.0 for Linux.
-fixed infinite loop 99% when iso files are corrupted;
-added Performer tag to dsf files;
-now multi-byte chars in filenames is supported for Windows when input files are iso (using wmain);
-better management in creating folders/files/tracks names (including albums with multiple discs);
-changed priority in title/artist extracting metadata. Now disc_title/disc_artist came first instead of album_title/album_artist (useful in case of multiple discs of an album);
-added -w (--concurrent) for compatibility with SACDExtractGUI;
-added -o (--output-dir[=DIR] ) and -y (--output-dir-conc[=DIR]) option for setting explicit output folder (for compatibility with SACDExtractGUI, except option -z  (--nopad);
-for DSF files the pop noise is reduced by padding the last block with '69'h instead of '00' (so --nopad option is useless);
-for DSF files some frames are trimmed out (based on timecode) to reflect the correct playing time of tracks;
-eliminates crashes when disk for output is full.
